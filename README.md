# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main point of this project
will be to create a letterhead using HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

To access VSCode Live Server, you must navigate to the index.html document in
the projects root, then click on the little square in the top right to show
the live preview right next to it. Or copy and pase the link it gives you
in the browser.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Note: there are no tests for this assignment as the main point was just to
display the letterhead.
